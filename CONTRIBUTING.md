# Contributing to TYPO3 Inertia Integration

We're in early development and welcome all contributions! The project aims to follow the official InertiaJS Laravel adapter as much as possible, adapting only what's necessary for TYPO3.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request

That's it! No extensive process, no strict rules. Do-ocracy.

## Recommendations

- Follow the [official Inertia.js Laravel adapter](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-laravel) patterns where possible  
- Follow TYPO3 standards when interacting with TYPO3
- If you're not sure about something, just ask in your PR or in an issue
- Breaking changes are fine at this stage - we're figuring things out
